✅ PROJECT OVERVIEW
🔷 Title:
"Bridging the Gaps in Modern Healthcare: From Fragmentation to Integration"

🔷 Problem Statement:
Modern healthcare systems face fragmentation between surplus medical supply management and digital health access in rural or under-resourced areas.

🧩 PLATFORM OVERVIEW
A web platform that merges two distinct yet interconnected workflows:

🔹 Track A — Medical Donation & Logistics
Hospitals list surplus medical supplies

NGOs/Rural Clinics can browse & request donations

Includes feedback & usage tracking

Works through a Donation Portal

🔹 Track B — Digital Health Record System
Clinics onboard patients

Digital health records created

QR Code-based access to records

AI tools for triage and awareness

Real-time access + SMS backup

🔗 Integration Point:
Both tracks feed into a Unified Impact Dashboard

Shows analytics on donation impact and patient outcomes

🖼️ VISUAL FLOW
You created a final flowchart infographic (slide-style) with two tracks:

Track A on the left (Donation Portal)

Track B on the right (Digital Health Record System)

Centered by "INTEGRATION" and the Impact Dashboard
